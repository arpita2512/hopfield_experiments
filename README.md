# Hopfield Experiments   

This is an implementation of the Hopfield Network for COMP5400M Bio-Inspired Computing: Coursework 2. 
The task is to evaluate image reconstruction using synchronous pattern recovery, and compare results with the asynchronous 
approach and Self-Organising Map. Experiments are performed using the [MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) dataset. 

For implementation details and results, please see the [documentation](https://hopfield-experiments.readthedocs.io/).
